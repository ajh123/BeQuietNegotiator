# List of known incompatible mods

This document lists mods that are known to be incompatible with Be Quiet Negotiator.

Compatibility issues will not be fixed by the Be Quiet Negotiator development team - as introducing fixes for every mod out there is insane and out of scope. Rather, users are encouraged to reach out to the respective mod authors for support.

Incompatible mods:
- **BetterMC mod-pack**: There are texture glitches when this mod-pack is installed alongside Be Quiet Negotiator. Users have reported mismatched textures and UI elements that do not render correctly. Please contact the BetterMC mod-pack developers for assistance. This is reported in [Issue #3](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/3)
