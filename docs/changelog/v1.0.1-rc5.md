This is the fifth release candidate for Be Quiet Negotiator v1.0.1.

Changes in this release:
- There is now a more robust solution for client ignoring packet decoding errors when connecting to a server (properly fixes: https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3011626189)
- `NetworkRegistryMixin` now checks `ClientConfig.bypassCustomFeatureFlags()` before calling `CheckFeatureFlags.handleVanillaServerConnection` to ensure custom feature flags are ignored when connecting to servers that do not support them (fixes: https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3066014192)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/compare/v1.0.1-rc3...v1.0.1-rc4

*If there are no significant issues this release will be promoted to v1.0.1 on both GitHub and Modrinth.*
