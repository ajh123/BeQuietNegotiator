This is another small hotfix release that addresses an issue caused by some leftover code from an earlier version.

Bug Fixes and Changes:
1. Remove the unused server side config as Be Quiet Negotiator is strictly client-side only (fixes: [#4](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/4))
2. The mods.toml file has been updated to reflect that Be Quiet Negotiator is a client-side only mod
