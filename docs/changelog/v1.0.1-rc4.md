This is the fourth release candidate for Be Quiet Negotiator v1.0.1.

Changes in this release:

- Fixed an issue where `isConnectedToVanillaServer` was not set early enough, causing `CheckFeatureFlags.handleVanillaServerConnection` to behave incorrectly.
  This broke due to a logic refactor in a previous release.
  The flag is now correctly set to `true` before the method runs.
