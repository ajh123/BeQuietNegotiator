This is the seventh release candidate for Be Quiet Negotiator v1.0.1.

Changes in this release:
- Unsupported server side patches are removed from the Be Quite Negotiator codebase.
- Renamed `acceptVanillaServer` to `bypassNegotiationErrors` to better reflect its purpose.
- Client side packet handling errors are now ignored when connecting to a vanilla server, allowing the client to connect without issues. (fixes: https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3067399173)
