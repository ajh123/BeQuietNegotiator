This release adds new error-handling features, improves mod compatibility, and fixes several bugs introduced in previous versions and release candidates.

New Features:

1. The client can now ignore custom feature flags when connecting to a vanilla server
   (fixes: [#1](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc1*)
2. The client can now ignore packet decoding errors when connecting to a server
   (fixes: [#1 (comment 3011626189)](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3011626189)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc2*)
3. Automated release pipelines for GitHub and Modrinth have been set up (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc2*)
4. The client now ignores packets larger than expected (fixes: [#1 (comment 3067088739)](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3067088739)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc6*)
5. Client side packet handling errors are now ignored when connecting to a vanilla server, allowing the client to connect without issues. (fixes: : [#1 (comment 3067399173)](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3067399173)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc7*)

Bug Fixes and Changes:

1. Patches are now disabled when connecting to NeoForge servers to prevent compatibility issues (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc2*)
2. Fixed all occurrences of the typo **"Quite"** (should have been **"Quiet"**) across the codebase (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc2*)
3. Fixed a crash caused by invalid access transformer syntax despite Architectury Loom successfully applying the access transformer (fixes: [#2](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/2)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc3*)
4. Fixed an issue where `isConnectedToVanillaServer` was not set early enough, causing `CheckFeatureFlags.handleVanillaServerConnection` to behave incorrectly (fixes: [#1 (comment 3065956489)](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3065956489)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc4*)
5. Improved the implementation for ignoring packet decoding errors to be more robust (properly fixes: [#1 (comment 3011626189)](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3011626189)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc5*)
6. `NetworkRegistryMixin` now checks `ClientConfig.bypassCustomFeatureFlags()` before calling `CheckFeatureFlags.handleVanillaServerConnection`
   to ensure custom feature flags are ignored when connecting to servers that do not support them (fixes: [#1 (comment 3066014192)](https://github.com/ajh123/BeQuietNegotiator/issues/1#issuecomment-3066014192)) (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc5*)
7. Renamed `acceptVanillaServer` to `bypassNegotiationErrors` to better reflect its purpose (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc7*)

Removed Features:

1. Unsupported server-side patches have been removed from the Be Quiet Negotiator codebase (*introduced in v1.0.1-rc7*)
